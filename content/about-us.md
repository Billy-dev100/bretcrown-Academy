## WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?

### Our Approach

We take a different view to other Traders who Spread-Bet. That is why we are extraordinarily successful.

First and foremost, our main product is Crude Oil, and one or two other Commodities and some FX. We do not allow products or Commodities outside of this to distort or influence our judgement.

Next, we are able to decipher and understand the News that is relevant to our products as well as the geopolitical events globally that affect the prices of the products we work with.

We consider and take into account all relevant Technical Indicators including Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Numbers and Lines, Exponential Moving Average, MACD, Pivot Point, Rate of Change, RSI and Standard Deviation and others, as appropriate.

We have the courage to take positions when we believe it is time to do so after carefully considering all relevant factors.

All of the above contribute to a positive outcome.

Our processes often involve special reviews.

As an example, we examined previous WTI CRUDE positions on twelve 'positive' Trading days selected at random and then compare these with BRENT CRUDE on the same days at the same trading times, i.e. between 06:00 GMT and 18:00 GMT.

This examination revealed that characteristically, BRENT CRUDE increased by 138 points per Trading day, but WTI CRUDE only rose by 90 points per Trading day for the same twelve Trading days. This evidence strongly suggests how BRENT CRUDE should be designated by us.

Similarly, we conducted a comparative assessment using a different twelve 'negative' Trading days selected at random on the same days at the same trading times. The results showed both BRENT CRUDE and WTI CRUDE declining routinely, in points per day of 52 for BRENT CRUDE and 72 for WTI CRUDE. This evidence also strongly suggests how WTI CRUDE should be designated by us.

Given the results of this examination, our Trades follow these suggested courses of action.

We will continue to conduct a similar analysis at regular intervals to ensure that we Open Trades appropriately in the Global circumstances prevailing at the time.

## Our Experience & Expertise

Neil G Van Luven has written a book on Spread-Betting Crude Oil, based on his experiences.

It covers fourteen weeks from 23 November 2018 to 04 March 2019 when Neil transformed $38,673 into $1,129,030 by Spread Betting Oil, taking advantage of the maximum Leverage offered by the Brokerage firm he selected. The success rate achieved was 92.6% of his Trades being profitable and only 7.4% resulting in losses by the number of Trades and 94.3% profitable with 5.7% losses by the monetary value of the Trades – all using Leverage of 4% or 1:25! There were 94 Trades in total, during this fourteen-week period, of which 57 were 'BUY' Trades and 37 were 'SELL' Trades. These results illustrate Neil's unique skillset as an Oil Trader.

The e-Book and paper-back versions are now [available at Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1075166098?ref_=pe_3052080_397514860). See cover below.

## Day-trading

<!-- ![](/images/original-10.jpg) -->
A Day-Trader is a Speculator in Securities, explicitly buying and selling Financial Instruments within the same Trading day, such that Positions are Closed before the Market closes for the same Trading day.

Traders who Trade in this capacity and with the motive of Profit are therefore Speculators, in contrast with the long-term Trades underlying buy and hold and value investing strategies. Day-Traders normally exit Positions before the Market closes to avoid unmanageable risks - negative Price gaps between one day's close and the next day's price at the open.

Only very occasionally, a Trade may over-run the close of the business day, but customarily Trades are Closed before the Trading day ends obtaining the best price possible.

Spread-Bets are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to Leverage, but Financial Spread-Betting is the tax-free way to take advantage of rising or falling Markets. When the Trader opens a Spread-Betting Position on a Market, he is given a 'BUY' and 'SELL' Price either side of the underlying Market Price – this is the Spread. If the Trader thinks the Market will rise, he Opens the Spread-Bet at the ‘BUY’ Price. If the Trader thinks the Market will fall, he Opens at the ‘SELL’ Price. The more the Market moves in the Trader’s favour, the higher his Profit. The more the Market moves against the Trader, the higher his loss.

Spread-Betting is a form of derivatives Trading that allows the Trader to take a position on whether he thinks a Market will rise or fall, without having to buy the underlying asset. Importantly, Spread-Betting is a Leveraged transaction, which means the Trader only puts down a small deposit for a much larger Market exposure.

## Why Bretcrown Provides Profitable Results

![](/images/advance-analysis-business-graph-data.jpg)
We use Bollinger Bands and Fibonacci Numbers and Lines as part of our Technical Indicators among others, including Exponential Moving Average, MACD, Pivot Point, Rate of Change, RSI and Standard Deviation.

We always use ‘Force Open’ Trading.

In the absence of ‘Force Open’ Trading, the Service Platform typically nets out the Position, effectively Closing the original Trade to register the new Trade which does not happen with ‘Force Open’ Trading because both Trades run in parallel, simultaneously.

Force Open enables us to Open new Trades on 'BUY' and 'SELL' Positions simultaneously when there is no definite reason to select just one Position.

Geopolitical factors of which there are many, that do not directly influence the Price of our product are extraneous to us and for the most part peripheral to our Trading. However, Reports or events that have a direct bearing on our products continue to be analysed and factored in. We sift through the ‘White Noise’ and concentrate on and consider only the factors that impact the daily Price of the product we are working with.

We use an intra-day technique known as Scalping that usually has us holding a Position for a few minutes or only seconds. A Scalp in Trading is the act of Opening and then Closing a Position very quickly, Profiting from small price movements. Traders who practise this tactic are referred to as Scalpers and will tend to make many Scalps each day. The theory behind Scalping is that small price movement is easier to predict than large ones. Profits on Scalps tend to be modest in relation to the Trade Size, but losses can be kept to a minimum as strict rules are adhered to.

We also use Trailing Stops. A Trailing Stop order is a specific type of ‘Stop-Loss’ that automatically follows our Position if the Market rises, securing our Profit, but it will remain in place if the Market falls – Closing out our Position if the Market moves against us. A Trailing Stop Order does not set the Stop Level at a specific price, but rather at a certain distance away from the current Market price. It would be placed below the current Market price if we open a 'BUY' Trade, and above the current Market price if we open a 'SELL' Trade. A Trailing Stop is set at a certain amount of points away from the Market price – this distance is the Trailing Stop – and the Stop will move to maintain that distance from the current price.
