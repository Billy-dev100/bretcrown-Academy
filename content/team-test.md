### Day Trading

Bretcrown is a Day-Trader, a Speculator in Securities, explicitly buying and selling Financial Instruments within the same Trading day, such that Positions are Closed before the Market closes for the same Trading day. This allows us to avoid unmanageable risks and negative price gaps between one day's close and next day's price at the open.

We Will Spread-bet Crude Oil ONLY and not allow other products to distort or influence our judgement. However, there are a small number of other Commodities that are so similar in nature that they fall under our umbrella. These include Gold, Silver and Palladium, as well as certain currencies in the FX market.
