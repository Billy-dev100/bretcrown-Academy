![](/images/force-open.jpg)Constant discipline and 100% concentration are required to achieve 'innovation leading' positive results. We Spread-Bet our selected products and do not allow other products to distort or influence our judgement. We decipher and understand the relevant News and geopolitical events globally that impact prices.

As an example, Oil stockpiles are officially updated every Wednesday by the Energy Information Administration and this is one of the leading disruptors/influencers of the Price that day and that week. By delaying Spread-Betting on CRUDE OIL by one day, by not Opening new Positions on Wednesdays, is logical and provides the best situation, however there are exceptions.

We take into account all relevant Technical Indicators including Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci Numbers and Lines, Exponential Moving Average, Pivot Point, Rate of Change, and Standard Deviation. We have the courage to take positions when we believe it is time to do so after carefully considering all relevant factors.

Today, we see through all the irrelevant Reports which we call ‘White Noise’ only to consider Reports that directly impact our products since this is where our developed  and perfected expertise and dedicated focus lies.

All of this makes it possible to provide a positive outcome and overcome the historic lack of success that Traders have had.
