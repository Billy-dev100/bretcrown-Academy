Every Trading platform warns retail Traders that 80% of such Traders lose their money. Many of these Traders are too small to deal with one of the recognised platforms, so they have nowhere to go to get help. As a result, these Traders either do not carry on searching, or they spend their money in some other way.

As soon as Bretcrown Trading Ltd completes its first year of Trading, it will also by then have acquired any and all formal approvals required by the Financial Conducts Authority in the UK to enable it to accept private retail investors and Trade on their behalf.  Once this has been finalised and the FCA approval has been granted, it will be ready to start Trading for private individuals.
